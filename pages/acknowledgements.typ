This work could not have taken place without the helps of the people around me. 

Sebastien, who was here every day at the HES, I hope I were as motivating as you were for me.

My family, who supported my studies from the start, encouraged me to give the best of myself, and helped me in many ways during the long years of my studies.

And lastly Marta, who is a model I try to reach in motivation, courage and dedication.
